A game where you must use physics to escape impending doom
Now using lua for maps!

Use Q and E to rotate, W to go forwards, S to go backwards,
Left shift to speed up, Left control to slow down,
Right shift to speed up time, Right control to slow down time,
Z to use dialogues, r to reset and scroll to zoom in and out.
